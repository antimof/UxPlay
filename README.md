This project is a  unix AirPlay server which  now also works on MacOs.
The work is based on https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay.
Tested on Ubuntu 19.10 desktop.
Tested on MacOS 10.15

Features:
1. Based on Gstreamer.
2. Video and audio are supported out of the box.
3. Gstreamer decoding is plugin agnostic. Uses accelerated decoders if
available. VAAPI is preferable, (but don't use VAAPI with nVidia)
4. Automatic screen orientation.

**Building this version** (Instructions for Ubuntu; adapt these for other Linuxes, and MacOs, see below).

In a terminal window, change directories to the UxPlay directory of the
downloaded source code, then do

1. sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libplist-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad 
2. sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-vaapi (For Intel graphics, but not nVidia graphics)
3. sudo apt-get install libx11-dev  (for the "ZOOMFIX" X11_display name fix for screen-sharing with e.g.,  ZOOM)
4. mkdir build
5. cd build
6. cmake ..      (or "cmake -DZOOMFIX=ON .." to get a screen-sharing fix to
make the mirror display window visible to screen-sharing applications such as
Zoom, see below).
7. make
8. sudo make install

Run uxplay in a terminal window.

**Note libplist-dev and (for ZOOMFIX) libx11-dev are new dependencies.**

**Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS:** 
(sudo yum install) openssl-devel libplist-devel avahi-compat-libdns_sd-devel (+libX11-devel for ZOOMFIX).   The required
GStreamer packages are:
gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel gstreamer1-libav gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free ( + gstreamer1-vaapi for intel graphics).

**OpenSUSE:**
(sudo zypper install) libopenssl-devel libplist-devel
avahi-compat-mDNSResponder-devel (+ libX11-devel for ZOOMFIX).  The required
GStreamer packages are:
gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel gstreamer-plugins-libav gstreamer-plugins-bad (+ gstreamer-plugins-vaapi for Intel graphics).

**MacOs**  (Currently only for Intel X86_64 Macs)

These instructions asssume that the Xcode command-line developer tools are installed (if Xcode is installed, open the Terminal, type "sudo xcode-select --install" and accept the conditions).

It is also assumed that CMake >= 2.13 is installed:
this can be done with package managers [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org),
[Fink](http://finkproject.org) or [Brew](http://brew.sh), or by a download from
[https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/).


Start by downloading the latest MacOs release of GStreamer-1.0
from [https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/).
Install both the MacOs runtime and development installer packages. Assuming that the latest release is 1.18.4 they are

```
gstreamer-1.0-1.18.4-x86_64.pkg
gstreamer-1.0-devel-1.18.4-x86_64.pkg
```
Click on them to install (they install to
/Library/FrameWorks/GStreamer.framework).
It is recommended you use GStreamer.framework rather than install Gstreamer with Brew or MacPorts (see later).

Next install OpenSSL-1.1.1 and libplist:
MacPorts: "sudo port install openssl liblist-dev "; Brew: "brew install openssl libplist".   Since the
static forms of these libraries are used in the MacOs build, the OpenSSL and libplist packages can be uninstalled after building uxplay
(so you could just install MacPorts or Brew before building uxplay, and uninstall it afterwards).
Unfortunately, Fink's openssl package currently doesn't supply the static (libcrypto.a) form of the needed library libcrypto, and it
does not supply a recent libplist.

If you have have the standard GNU toolset (autoconf, automake, libtool, etc.) installed,
you can also  download and compile the source code for these libraries from
[https://www.openssl.org/source/](https://www.openssl.org/source/), 
[https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist).
Compile the downloaded
openssl-1.1.1 by opening a terminal in your Downloads directory, and  unpacking the source distribution openssl-1.1.1x.tar.gz (where "x" is a "patch" label,
currently given by  "x" = "l"):
("tar -xvzf openssl-1.1.1x.tar.gz ; cd openssl-1.1.1x"). Then install with
"./config; make ; sudo make install_dev" and clean up after building uxplay  with "sudo make uninstall" in the same directory.
Similarly, for libplist, download the source as a zipfile from github as
[libplist-master.zip](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), then
unpack ("unzip libplist-master.zip ; cd libplist-master"), compile
("./autogen.sh ; make ; sudo make install)" and clean up after uxplay is built  with "sudo uninstall"  in the same directory.  

Finally, build and install uxplay (without ZOOMFIX):
"cd UxPlay; mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake .. ; make ; sudo make install ".

The MacOs build uses OpenGL, not X11, to create the mirror display window.   This has some "quirks":
the window title is "OpenGL renderer" instead of the Airplay server name, but it is visible to
screen-sharing apps (e.g., Zoom).   The option -t _timeout_
cannot be used because if the GStreamer pipeline is destroyed while the OpenGL window is still open,
and uxplay is left running, a segfault occurs.
Also, the resolution settings "-s wxh" do not affect
the (small) initial mirror window size, but the window can be expanded using the mouse.


**Other ways (Brew, MacPorts) to install GStreamer on MacOs (not recommended):**

First make sure that pkgconfig is installed  (Brew: "brew install pkgconfig" ; MacPorts: "sudo port install pkgconfig" ).  

(a) with Brew: "brew gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-libav".   This appears to be functionally equivalent
to using GStreamer.framework, but causes a large number of extra packages to be installed by Brew as dependencies.

(b) with MacPorts: "sudo port install gstreamer1-gst-plugins-good gstreamer1-gst-plugins-bad gstreamer1-gst-libav".
The MacPorts GStreamer is built to use X11, so must be run from an XQuartz terminal, can use ZOOMFIX, and needs
option "-vs ximagesink".  On an older unibody MacBook Pro, the default setting wxh = 1920x1080 was too large  for
the non-retina display, but 800x600 worked; However, the Gstreamer pipeline is fragile against attempts to change
the X11 window size, or to rotations that switch a connected iPad client between portrait and landscape mode while uxplay is running. 
Using the MacPorts X11 GStreamer is only viable if the image size is left unchanged from the initial "-s wxh" setting. 

# **Troubleshooting:**

If uxplay starts, but stalls after "Initialized server socket(s)" appears,
it is probably because a firewall is blocking
access to the server on which it is running.  If possible, either turn off the firewall
to see if that is the problem, or get three consecutive network ports,
starting at port n, all three in the range 1024-65535, opened  for both tcp and udp, and use "uxplay -p n"
(or open UDP 6000, 6001, 6011 TCP 7000,7001,7100 and use "uxplay -p").

Try "uxplay -d " (debug log option)  to see what is happening. If you use an
nVidia graphics card, make sure that the gstreamer1.0-vaapi
plugin for Intel graphics is *NOT* installed (de-install it!).
(You can test for this  by explicitly choosing the GStreamer videosink with option
"-vs ximagesink" or "-vs xvimagesink", to see if this fixes the problem, or "-vs vaapisink" to see if this
reproduces the problem.)

If your mirror window has no title showing, the "ZOOMFIX" will not work.
The window is created by GStreamer, using a  videosink that the default "autovideosink" 
has chosen for you. Maybe an unusual videosink was chosen.   Fix: use the -vs option to make your own choice of videosink:
"-vs xvimagesink" or "-vs ximagesink" will create window titles on displays managed by X11.


#  **Usage:**

Options:
**-n server_name **;  server_name will be the name that appears offering
AirPlay services to your iPad, iPhone etc.
**NEW**: this will also now be the name shown above the mirror display (X11)  window, 

**-s wxh** (e.g. -s 1920x1080 , which is the default ) sets the display resolution (width and height,
   in pixels).   (This may be a
   request made to the AirPlay client, and perhaps will not
   be the final resolution you get.)   w and h are whole numbers with four
   digits or less.   Note that the **height** pixel size is the controlling
   one used by the client for determining the streaming format; the width is
   dynamically adjusted to the shape of the image (portait or landscape
   format, depending on how an iPad is held, for example). 

**-s wxh@r**  As above, but also informs the AirPlay  client about the screen
   refresh rate of the display. Default is r=60 (60 Hz); r is a whole number
   with three digits or less.   Values greater that 255 are ignored.
   
**-fps n ** sets a maximum frame rate (in frames per second) for the AirPlay
   client to stream video; n must be a whole number with 3 digits or less.
   (The client may choose to serve video at any frame rate lower
   than this;  default is 30 fps.)  A setting
   below 30 fps might be useful to reduce latency if you are running more than
   one instance of uxplay at the same time.   Values greater than 255 are
   ignored.  This setting is only an advisory to the client device, so setting
   a high value will not force a high framerate.
   (You can test using "-vs fpsdisplaysink" to see what framerate is being
   received.)
   
**-o** turns on an "overscanned" option for the display window.    This
   reduces the image resolution by using some of the pixels requested
   by  option -s wxh (or their default values 1920x1080) by adding an empty
   boundary frame of unused pixels (which would be lost in a full-screen
   display that overscans, and is not displayed by gstreamer).
   Recommendation: **don't use this option** unless there is some special
   reason to use it.

**-p**  allows you to select the network ports used by UxPlay (these need
   to be opened if the server is behind a firewall).   By itself, -p sets
   "legacy" ports TCP 7100, 7000, 7001, UDP 6000, 6001, 7011.   -p n (e.g. -p
   35000)  sets TCP and UDP ports n, n+1, n+2.  -p n1,n2,n3 (comma-separated
   values) sets each port separately; -p n1,n2 sets ports n1,n2,n2+1.  -p tcp n
   or -p udp n sets just the TCP or UDP ports.  Ports must be in the range
   [1024-65535].

If the -p option is not used, the ports are chosen dynamically (randomly),
which will not work if a firewall is running.

**-m**  generates a random MAC address to use instead of the true hardware MAC
   number of the computer's network card.   (Different server_name,  MAC
   addresses,  and network ports are needed for each running uxplay  if you
   attempt to  run two instances of uxplay on the same computer.)
   On MacOs, random MAC addresses are always used.

**-a** disable audio, leaving only the video playing.

Also: image transforms that had been added to RPiPlay have been ported to UxPlay:

**-f {H|V|I}**  implements "videoflip" image transforms: H = horizontal flip
(right-left flip, or mirror image); V = vertical flip ;  I =
180 degree rotation or inversion (which is the combination of H with V).

**-r {R|L}**  90 degree Right (clockwise) or Left (counter-clockwise)
   rotations; these are carried out after any **-f** transforms.

**-vs _videosink_** chooses the GStreamer videosink, instead of letting
   autovideosink pick it for you. For example, xvimagesink, vaapisink, or
   fpsdisplaysink (which shows the streaming framerate in fps).   Using quotes
   "..." might allow some parameters to be included with the videosink name. 
   (Some choices of videosink might not work on your system.)

**-t _timeout_**  will cause the server to relaunch (without stopping uxplay) if no connections
have been present during the previous _timeout_ seconds.  (You may wish to use this  because an idle Bonjour
registration eventually becomes unavailable for new connections.)  This option should not be
used if the display window is an OpenGL window (e.g., on MacOS without X11), as an  OpenGL window created
by GStreamer does not terminate correctly (it causes a segfault)
if it is still open when the  GStreamer pipeline is closed.


# ChangeLog
1.35  2021-09-10   now uses a GLib MainLoop, and builds on MacOS (tested on Intel Mac, 10.15 ).
                   New option  -t _timeout_ for relauching server if no connections were active in
                   previous _timeout_ seconds (to renew Bonjour registration).
                   
1.341 2021-09-04   fixed: render logger was not being destroyed by stop_server()

1.34  2021-08-27   Fixed "ZOOMFIX": the X11 window name fix was only being made the
                   first time the GStreamer window was created by uxplay, and
		   not if the server was relaunched after the GStreamer window
		   was closed, with uxplay still running.   Corrected in v. 1.34

# New features available: (v 1.35 2021-09-10)

1. Updates of the RAOP (AirPlay protocol)  collection of codes  maintained
at  https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay.git so it is current as of 2021-08-01,
adding all changes since the original release of UxPlay by antimof.
This involved crypto updates, replacement
of the included plist library by the system-installed version, and  a change
over to a library llhttp for http parsing. 

2. Added the -s, -o -p, -m, -r,  -f,  -fps  -vs and -t  options.

3. If "cmake -DZOOMFIX=ON .."  is run before compiling,
the mirrored window is now visible to screen-sharing applications such as
Zoom. To compile with ZOOMFIX=ON, the X11 development libraries must be installed.
(ZOOMFIX will not be needed once the upcoming  gstreamer-1.20 is available,
since starting with that release, the GStreamer mirror window will be natively
visible for screen-sharing.) Thanks to David Ventura
https://github.com/DavidVentura/UxPlay for the fix
and also for getting it into  gstreamer-1.20.
[If uxplay was compiled after
cmake was run without -DZOOMFIX=ON, and your gstreamer version is older than
1.20, you can still manually make the window visible to screen-sharing apps with the X11 utility
xdotool, if it is installed, with: 
```
 xdotool selectwindow set_window --name <name>
```
, where ```<name>``` is your choice of name, and then select the uxplay window
by clicking on it with the mouse.]

4. The AirPlay server now terminates correctly when the gstreamer display window is
closed, and is relaunched with the same settings to wait for a new connection.
The program uxplay terminates when Ctrl-C is typed in the terminal window. 

5.   In principle, multiple instances of uxplay can be run simultaneously
using the **-m** (generate random MAC address) option to give each a
different ("local" as opposed to "universal")  MAC address.
If the **-p [n]** option is used, they also need separate network port choices.
(However, there may be a large latency, and running two instances of uxplay
simultaneously on the same computer may not be very useful; using -fps option
to force streaming framerates below 30fps could be useful.)

6.  Without the **-p** [n] option,  uxplay makes a random dynamic assignment of
network ports. This will not work if most ports are closed by a firewall.
With e.g., **-p 45000**   you should open both TCP and UDP on
ports 45000, 45001, 45002.   Minimum allowed port is 1024, maximum is 65535.
The option "**-p**" with no argument uses a "legacy" set of ports TCP 7100,
7000, 7001, and UDP  7011, 6000, 6001.

7.  The default resolution setting is 1920x1080 width x height pixels.
To change this, use "**-s wxh**"  where w and h are positive  decimals
with 4 or less digits.   It seems that the width and height may be negotiated
with the AirPlay client, so this may not be the actual screen geometry that
displays.

8.The title on the GStreamer display window is now is the AirPlay server name
(default "UxPlay", but can be changed with option **-n**), rather than the program
name "uxplay" (note the difference in capitalization).  (This works for X11 windows created
by gstreamer videosinks ximagesink, xvimagesink, but not OpenGL windows created by glimagesink.)

9. The avahi_compat "nag" warning on startup is suppressed, by placing
"AVAHI_COMPAT_NOWARN=1" into the runtime environment when uxplay starts.
(This uses a call to putenv() in a form that is believed to be safe against
memory leaks, at least in modern Linux; if for any reason you don't want
this fix, comment out the line in CMakeLists.txt that activates it when uxplay
is compiled.) On MacOS, Avahi is not used.

# AirPlay protocol versions

For multiple reasons, it's very difficult to clearly define the protocol names and versions of the components that make up the AirPlay streaming system. In fact, it seems like the AirPlay version number used for marketing differs from that used in the actual implementation. In order to tidy up this whole mess a bit, I did a little research that I'd like to summarize here:


The very origin of the AirPlay protocol suite was launched as AirTunes sometime around 2004. It allowed to stream audio from iTunes to an AirPort Express station. Internally, the name of the protocol that was used was RAOP, or Remote Audio Output Protocol. It seems already back then, the protocol involved AES encryption. A public key was needed for encrypting the audio sent to an AirPort Express, and the private key was needed for receiving the protocol (ie used in the AirPort Express to decrypt the stream). Already in 2004, the public key was reverse-engineered, so that [third-party sender applications](http://nanocr.eu/2004/08/11/reversing-airtunes/) were developed.


Some time [around 2008](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2008/01/10/a-tour-of-airfoil-3/), the protocol was revised and named AirTunes 2. It seems the changes primarily concerned timing. By 2009, the new protocol was [reverse-engineered and documented](https://git.zx2c4.com/Airtunes2/about/).


When the Apple TV 2nd generation was introduced in 2010, it received support for the AirTunes protocol. However, because this device allowed playback of visual content, the protocol was extended and renamed AirPlay. It was now possible to stream photo slideshows and videos. Shortly after the release of the Apple TV 2nd generation, AirPlay support for iOS was included in the iOS 4.2 update. It seems like at that point, the audio stream was still actually using the same AirTunes 2 protocol as described above. The video and photo streams were added as a whole new protocol based on HTTP, pretty much independent from the audio stream. Soon, the first curious developers began to [investigate how it worked](https://web.archive.org/web/20101211213705/http://www.tuaw.com/2010/12/08/dear-aunt-tuaw-can-i-airplay-to-my-mac/). Their conclusion was that visual content is streamed unencrypted.


In April 2011, a talented hacker [extracted the AirPlay private key](http://www.macrumors.com/2011/04/11/apple-airplay-private-key-exposed-opening-door-to-airport-express-emulators/) from an AirPort Express. This meant that finally, third-party developers were able to also build AirPlay reveiver (server) programs.


For iOS 5, released in 2011, Apple added a new protocol to the AirPlay suite: AirPlay mirroring. [Initial investigators](https://www.aorensoftware.com/blog/2011/08/20/exploring-airplay-mirroring-internals/) found this new protocol used encryption in order to protect the transferred video data.


By 2012, most of AirPlay's protocols had been reverse-engineered and [documented](https://nto.github.io/AirPlay.html). At this point, audio still used the AirTunes 2 protocol from around 2008, video, photos and mirroring still used their respective protocols in an unmodified form, so you could still speak of AirPlay 1 (building upon AirTunes 2). The Airplay server running on the Apple TV reported as version 130. The setup of AirPlay mirroring used the xml format, in particular a stream.xml file.
Additionally, it seems like the actual audio data is using the ALAC codec for audio-only (AirTunes 2) streaming and AAC for mirror audio. At least these different formats were used in [later iOS versions](https://github.com/espes/Slave-in-the-Magic-Mirror/issues/12#issuecomment-372380451).


Sometime before iOS 9, the protocol for mirroring was slightly modified: Instead of the "stream.xml" API endpoint, the same information could also be querried in binary plist form, just by changing the API endpoint to "stream", without any extension. I wasn't able to figure out which of these was actually used by what specific client / server versions.


For iOS 9, Apple made [considerable changes](https://9to5mac.com/2015/09/11/apple-ios-9-airplay-improvements-screen-mirroring/) to the AirPlay protocol in 2015, including audio and mirroring. Apparently, the audio protocol was only slightly modified, and a [minor change](https://github.com/juhovh/shairplay/issues/43) restored compatibility. For mirroring, an [additional pairing phase](https://github.com/juhovh/shairplay/issues/43#issuecomment-142115959) was added to the connection establishment procedure, consisting of pair-setup and pair-verify calls. Seemingly, these were added in order to simplify usage with devices that are connected frequently. Pair-setup is used only the first time an iOS device connects to an AirPlay receiver. The generated cryptographic binding can be used for pair-verify in later sessions. Additionally, the stream / stream.xml endpoint was replaced with the info endpoint (only available as binary plist AFAICT).
As of iOS 12, the protocol introduced with iOS 9 was still supported with only slight modifications, albeit as a legacy mode. While iOS 9 used two SETUP calls (one for general connection and mirroring video, and one for audio), iOS 12 legacy mode uses 3 SETUP calls (one for general connection (timing and events), one for mirroring video, one for audio).


The release of tvOS 10.2 broke many third-party AirPlay sender (client) programs in 2017. The reason was that it was now mandatory to perform device verification via a pin in order to stream content to an Apple TV. The functionality had been in the protocol before, but was not mandatory. Some discussion about the new scheme can be found [here](https://github.com/postlund/pyatv/issues/79). A full specification of the pairing and authentication protocol was made available on [GitHub](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/philippe44/RAOP-Player/blob/master/doc/auth_protocol.html). At that point, tvOS 10.2 reported as AirTunes/320.20.


In tvOS 11, the reported server version was [increased to 350.92.4](https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd/issues/377#issuecomment-309213273).


iOS 11.4 added AirPlay 2 in 2018. Although extensively covered by the media, it's not entirely clear what changes specifically Apple has made protocol-wise.


From captures of the traffic between an iOS device running iOS 12.2 and an AppleTV running tvOS 12.2.1, one can see that the communication on the main mirroring HTTP connection is encrypted after the initial handshake.
This could theoretically be part of the new AirPlay 2 protocol. The AppleTV running tvOS 12.2.1 identifies as AirTunes/380.20.1.
When connecting from the same iOS device to an AppleTV 3rd generation (reporting as AirTunes/220.68), the communication is still visible in plain. From the log messages that the iOS device produces when connected to an AppleTV 3rd generation, it becomes apparent that the iOS device is treating this plain protocol as the legacy protocol (as originally introduced with iOS 9). Further research showed that at the moment, all available third-party AirPlay mirroring receivers (servers) are using this legacy protocol, including the open source implementation of dsafa22, which is the base for RPiPlay. Given Apple considers this a legacy protocol, it can be expected to be removed entirely in the future. This means that all third-party AirPlay receivers will have to be updated to the new (fully encrypted) protocol at some point.

More specifically, the encryption starts after the pair-verify handshake completed, so the fp-setup handshake is already happening encrypted. Judging from the encryption scheme for AirPlay video (aka HLS Relay), likely two AES GCM 128 ciphers are used on the socket communication (one for sending, one for receiving). However, I have no idea how the keys are derived from the handshake data.
